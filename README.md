🚀 SQL Case Study – Swiggy Dataset
Excited to share my latest SQL case study where I solved real-world business queries on a Swiggy-like food delivery dataset.
📊 Key problems I tackled:
Customers who never ordered 🍽️
Average price per dish 💰
Top restaurants by orders in a month 🏆
Monthly sales filters & revenue growth 📈
Customer order history in a date range 🗓️
Restaurants with maximum repeated customers 🔄
Customer favorite food ❤️
Month-over-month revenue analysis 📊
Revenue growth for a particular restaurant 🍴
Most paired products ordered together (like fries + burger combos!) 🥤🍔

💡 This case study not only sharpened my SQL skills (joins, window functions, aggregation, CTEs) but also covered some of the most common SQL interview questions, such as:
Find customers who never placed an order ❓
Find the average price of a dish ❓
Month-over-month growth calculation ❓
Customer’s favorite food ❓
Find items frequently bought together ❓
